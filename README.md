# Mobile
As part of our application process, we'd like to see what you can produce by giving you a take home assessment.

# Test Specification
You are required to implement a feature in a flutter app as seen on this Figma board (https://www.figma.com/file/E58Po1bJ3D5b095xmaUFqf/Mobile-Engineer-Testing-(Copy)?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=NsD3JGoA6jqVa7f3-0).

# Scenerio
You are a mobile engineer in the shuttlers team and are tasked with implementing live tracking for a new product the team is working on.

The feature has the following acceptance criteria:
- A user should get a notification informing them to get ready for their trip.
- Notification should be clickable and should open the app to a tracking screen as shown in the design.
- The screen should have the following state:
    - [ ] for user not yet at pickup point
    - [ ] user at pickup point
    - [ ] user onboard the bus and moving to dropoff point
    - [ ] user moving to destination
    - [ ] user arrived at destination. 
- A screen to rate the trip.

# Expectations
You are expected to use your Intuition and creativity to fill in the missing blanks. We will be testing for Skill, Intuition and Creativity.

Please take note of the following points:

- Only use Flutter to get it done
- UI Frameworks like VelocityX won't be accepted
- A Mobile Responsive design will be an added advantage
- Also make sure that your project is on github and accessible to us

You'll be assessed based on but not limited to the following:

- Design implementation
- Coding pattern
- Project architecture
- Proper Component decomposition and reuse
- Correctness of dart syntax. Effective dart is important to us.
- Demonstration of knowledge of the chosen framework (flutter)
- Tests

# Bonus points
- Setting up github actions to run tests, coverage report and build example app
- Add coverage report badge to tell %coverage

# How do I submit?
* Create a github repository, implement your solution and send us the link.
* Create a ReadMe file with `firstname-lastname.md` (where firstname and lastname are your 
  first and last name respectively) where you add relevant information on how to setup/run/test your submission
